This is a total GUI based project in JAVA which is used to manage gym members details like their name, fathers name, cnic, mobile number, and payment details.
This is a good approach for Gym Admins to manage their gym member details.
In this gym management system, you can add members, update and delete their details, check their payment status and all-together check the details of the members in the gym.
I have used JDBC to connect a database to this project to store all the data.
Overall, this project is made with JAVA GUI and MySQL to store the data at backend.
